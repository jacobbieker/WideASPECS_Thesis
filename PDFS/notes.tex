Sfr density plot use for talking about why look at the gas and stuff, why it's important and not well constrained, not so much about the actual Sfr, but still important 

CO luminosity function plot? Or density plots? For the comparison with the uv ones and how worse constrained it is. 

Have an example of clustering plot or halo masses - taken from survey description maybe? 

Create tables for the results 

Look at history of clustering? Take Sanders look at it, use example of perturbations in for clustering and stuff 


Talk more about main sequence of galaxies and why important, why we expect above main sequence 

Clustering talk about random points, how generated they are, show random random plot with consistent with 0 fits - need to generate that 

Show random and non random points in a plot as well
