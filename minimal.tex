\abstract{In this research, data from the Wide ASPECS survey is used to look at the clustering and properties of blindly selected CO emitters within the GOODS-South region of the sky. The frequency range covered enables the identification of CO emission lines up to a $z = 4.4$. The survey builds on the results of the ASPECS Pilot and Large Program surveys, with 35 potential CO line candidates found, and 3 lines matched with counterparts. The properties of these counterparts are examined to determine the physical properties of CO emitters within the field. There is clear increase in the two-point correlation function at higher fidelities for the CO line candidates, suggesting that there are real sources present, although the results are quite noisy. A comparison of the $r_0$ for these CO sources to the $r_0$ for other populations of galaxies is performed. These results build toward calculating the first direct constraints on the clustering bias of CO emitters, and therefore their halo mass.}

\chapter{Introduction}

Gas is the building block of stars and galaxies, and molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) is the fuel for star formation \cite{decarli2019alma}. This gas can inform us about the evolution of galaxies and large scale structure in the universe, especially as observations cover larger and larger volumes of space. Using radio and submm telescopes, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), this gas can be observed through looking for the transition lines of carbon monoxide (CO). In the Wide ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (Wide ASPECS) survey, ALMA has been used to observe the largest volume of space yet for CO emissions, on the order of 550,000 cMpc. This enables the ability to look at these CO emitters in bulk for the first time.

This project is focused on using Wide ASPECS to estimate the properties of CO emitters, and to determine the spatial density of CO emitters. Building upon the success of the previous ASPECS Pilot and Large Program surveys \cite{walter2016alma, decarli2019alma}, this research also works to cross-match detected CO lines with galaxies present in the survey volume, and builds the basis for future work with this data on constraining the CO luminosity function, the cosmic density of molecular gas in galaxies $\rho(H_2)$, and the clustering bias of CO emitters.

\section{Creating Galaxies}

The initial seeds that created the large scale structure of the universe all came from tiny perturbations which are observable today in the cosmic microwave background. These slight differences in density caused dark matter to clump together. These clumps of dark matter pulled in gas, creating giant clouds. Some of the gas further collapsed to create stars, which in turn formed galaxies.

As a result of this process, galaxies are composed of gas, dust, and stars in various quantities, and so evolve in different ways. Starburst galaxies, for example, are undergoing massive amounts of star formation, and therefore are very bright and use up the gas available to them fairly quickly. On the other hand, main sequence galaxies tend to have much lower star formation rates, and therefore deplete their gas at a much slower rate \cite{scoville2017evolution, silverman2015higher}.

These differences in behavior result in varying amounts and types of light being emitted from different types of galaxies. Young stars, for example, tend to emit most of their light in the ultraviolet, and so galaxies with large amounts of ultraviolet light tend to have had large amounts of recent star formation. Dust, on the other hand, tends to absorb the ultraviolet and visible light emitted by stars and re-emits the light at longer wavelengths, such as the infrared. By looking at all the light that a galaxy emits therefore, the properties and makeup of a galaxy can be estimated.

\section{Observing Galaxies}

Parts of a galaxy are easy to observe, and other parts are not. Stars are relatively simple to observe; simply point a telescope like Hubble for long enough at a particular point in the sky and stars become visible. Gas on the other hand, especially the cold gas that collapses to form stars, is much more difficult to detect.

Most of the gas in the universe is made up of hydrogen. Unfortunately for astronomers, molecular hydrogen, $H_2$, is only bright enough to observe when it is relatively hot, around 500 Kelvin \cite{decarli2019alma}. As the cold gas that births stars does not usually reach 500 Kelvin, carbon monoxide (CO) is observed instead. CO is the second most common molecule after $H_2$, but has the advantages of having bright rotational transitions that can be observed all the way to very high redshifts \cite{walter2016alma, decarli2019alma}. Additionally, the amount of $H_2$ gas present can be inferred from the amount of CO that can be detected by using a conversion factor $\alpha_{CO}$ \cite{decarli2019alma}. 

These CO transition lines show up in the radio and (sub)mm spectrum, requiring telescopes such as ALMA and the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to be used to detect them on Earth \cite{decarli2019alma}. 

\section{From Observations to Models}

All observations of a galaxy recorded in gamma and X-rays, visible light, infrared, radio and other wavelengths gives us part of the total spectral energy distribution (SED) of that galaxy. The more wavelengths a galaxy is measured in, the better constrained the SED, and the more complete our understanding of its energy distribution. Software, such as MAGPHYS \cite{da2008simple, da2015alma}, can use these observations to estimate a galaxy's physical parameters. These programs match the observed SED to precomputed models and outputs likelihood estimates for the properties of a given galaxy, such as the star formation rate, mass, dust temperature, and more.

\section{Galaxies in Groups}

The next stage after observing and modeling individual galaxies is to look at galaxies in clusters. By looking at the distribution of galaxies in a given region of space we can determine how densely packed together they are and that in turn, gives us an insight into the amount of dark matter that surrounds them.

Galaxies are not distributed entirely randomly in the universe. On the largest scales, the universe is isotropic and homogeneous, but on smaller scales, galaxies tend to cluster in space. One way to quantify how densely packed a population of galaxies is to compute the so-called two-point correlation function. This allows for the measuring of the mass of the dark matter halos in which these galaxies reside \cite{hickox2011clustering}. The more clustered a population of galaxies are, the more massive the halo that they are in.

This report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 focuses on the setup of the survey, the methods used to detect and cross-match lines, and the properties of those matched galaxies. Chapter 3 focuses on the clustering of CO emitters in the survey volume, and compares the clustering of sources in this survey to those of other populations of galaxies. The final chapter, Chapter 4, contains the conclusions and possible future work. 

In this report, the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is assumed, with $H_0$=70 km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m$ = 0.3, and $\Omega_{\lambda}$ = 0.7, consistent with the results from the Planck Collaboration \cite{ade2016planck}.

\section{Future Work}

While these results are interesting, they are quite tentative. The clustering results could be improved through performing the cross-correlation between the CO line candidates and the galaxy catalog \cite{hickox2011clustering, 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.20303.x, 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14071.x}. 

Additional work could be done to verify the CO lines matched to galaxies, and investigate the reasons as to why the matched galaxies are much less massive and star forming than expected.
