\abstract{In this report, data from the Wide ASPECS survey is used to look at the clustering and halo masses of CO emitters within the GOODS-South region of the sky. The survey builds on the results of the ASPECS Pilot and Large Program surveys, cross-matching detected CO lines to galaxies. There is a clear increase in the two-point correlation function at higher fidelities for the CO line candidates.}

Gas is the building block of stars and galaxies, and cold gas constitutes the majority of the interstellar medium (ISM). This gas can inform us about the evolution of galaxies and large scale structure in the universe, especially as observations cover larger and larger volumes of space. Using radio and submm telescopes, such as the Atacama Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), this gas can be observed through looking for the transition lines of carbon monoxide (CO). In the Wide ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (Wide ASPECS) survey, ALMA has been used to observe the largest volume of space yet for CO emissions, on the order of 550,000 cMpc, enabling for the first time the ability to look at these CO emitters in bulk. [NEEDS WORK]

This project is focused on using Wide ASPECS to estimate the properties of CO emitters, determine how clustered together CO emitters are in space, and constrain the mass of the dark matter halos that these emitters reside within. Additionally, this research works to cross-match detected CO lines with galaxies present in the survey volume, and builds the basis for future work on constraining the CO luminosity function and the density of molecular gas, building upon the success of the previous ASPECS Pilot and Large Program surveys \cite{walter2016alma, decarli2019alma}. 

\section{From the Beginning}

The initial seeds that created the large scale structure of the universe all come from tiny perturbations, observable today in the cosmic microwave background. These differences caused dark matter, the unseen matter that makes up 85\% of all matter in the universe, to clump together. These clumps of dark matter pulled in gas, creating giant clouds. Some of the gas would further collapse to create stars, and together form galaxies.

Because of this process, galaxies are composed of gas, dust, and stars in varying quantities, and so evolve in different ways. Starburst galaxies, for example, are undergoing massive amounts of star formation, and therefore are very bright and are using up the gas available to them fairly quickly. On the other hand, other galaxies have much lower masses and much lower star formation rates, that result in them depleting their gas at a much slower rate. [AWKWARD MAKE CLEARER]

These differences in behavior result in varying amounts and kinds of light being emitted from distinct types of galaxies. Young stars, for example, tend to emit most of their light in the ultraviolet, and so galaxies with large amounts of ultraviolet light tend to have had large amounts of recent star formation. Gas, on the other hand, tends to absorb the ultraviolet and visible light emitted by stars and re-emits the light at longer wavelengths, such as the infrared. Because of this, by looking at all the light that a galaxy emits, the spectral energy distribution (SED), the properties and makeup of a galaxy can be estimated.

\section{Observing Galaxies}

Parts of a galaxy are easy to observe, and other parts are not. Stars are relatively simple to observe, simply point a telescope like Hubble long enough at a point in the sky and they start to show up. Gas on the other hand, especially the cold gas that collapses to form stars, is much more difficult to detect. [CHANGE] 

Most of the gas in the universe is made up of hydrogen. Unfortunately for astronomers, molecular hydrogen, $H_2$, is only bright enough to observe when it is relatively hot, around 500 Kelvin \cite{decarli2019alma}. As the gas does not generally get this hot in the cold gas that births stars [REWORD], carbon monoxide (CO) is used instead. CO is the second most common molecule after $H_2$, but has the advantages of having bright rotational transitions that can be observed all the way to very high redshifts \cite{walter2016alma, decarli2019alma}. Additionally, the amount of $H_2$ gas can be inferred from the amount of CO that can be detected by using a straightforward conversion factor called $\alpha_{CO}$ [CITE]. 

These CO transition lines show up in the radio and (sub)mm spectrum, requiring telescopes such as ALMA and the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to detect them on Earth \cite{decarli2019alma}. 

\section{From Observations to Models}

All observations of a galaxy, in gamma and X-rays, visible light, infrared, radio and other wavelengths, gives us part of the SED of that galaxy. The more wavelengths a galaxy is measured in, the better constrained the SED, and the more complete our understanding of its energy distribution. The observed fluxes and values are used as inputs into programs that use simulated models to estimate a galaxy's physical parameters and total SED. These programs, such as MAGPHYS \cite{da2008simple, da2015alma}, match the observed SED to precomputed models and outputs likelihood estimates for the properties of a given galaxy, such as the star formation rate, mass, dust temperature, and more.

\section{Galaxies in Groups}

The next stage after observing and modelling individual galaxies is to look at galaxies in clusters. By looking at the distribution of galaxies in a given region of space, we can determine how densely packed together they are, which gives an insight into the amount of dark matter that surrounds a cluster of galaxies. [INSERT WHY IMPORTANT]

Galaxies are not distributed entirely randomly in the universe. On the largest scales, the universe is isotropic and homogeneous, but on smaller scales, galaxies tend to form large filaments and clusters in space. Computing the two-point correlation function and clustering parameters attempts to give a sense to how clustered a set of galaxies are. The more clustered the galaxies are, generally the more massive the halo of dark matter that surrounds them. [DOUBLE CHECK THIS]

[MAYBE INCLUDE THE BACKGROUND PHYSICS/MATH HERE FOR DM HALOS?]

This report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 focuses on the setup of the survey, the methods used to detect and cross-match lines, and the properties of those matched galaxies. Chapter 3 focuses on the clustering of CO emitters in the survey volume, and compares the clustering of sources in this survey to those of other populations of galaxies. The final chapter, chapter 4, contains the conclusions and possible future work. 

In this report, the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is assumed, with $H_0$=70 km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m$ = 0.3, and $\Omega_{\lambda}$ = 0.7, consistent with the results from the Planck Collaboration \cite{ade2016planck}. The analysis code used in this report is available \href{https://github.com/jacobbieker/Wide\_ASPECS}{here: https://github.com/jacobbieker/Wide\_ASPECS}.

\section{Future Work}

[ADD HOW TO CONVERT TO LUMINOSITIES? AND GAS DENSITY? OR REFERENCE THE PAPERS AT LEAST]
The future work includes improving the clustering measurement by performing the cross-correlation with the galaxy catalog, which should improve the S/N of the clustering measurement versus the current auto-correlation. In addition, the CO luminosity function and density of molecular gas could also be computed from the data available, through converting the line fluxes to luminosities, for the CO luminosity function, then continuing and converting the luminosities to gas densities. Additional work could be done to verify the CO lines matched to galaxies,and investigate why the lines seem to match to so few galaxies, and galaxies that are so much lower on the Mstar vs SFR plot than would be expected.

For example, star formation has not stayed at a constant rate through cosmic time. Generally, galaxies had a higher star formation rate (SFR) in the past than today, with the peak star formation happening around 10 billion years ago, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:SFR_History}. To sustain this star formation rate, there needs to be enough gas available to make new stars, and it has been observed that the fraction of gas in galaxies tends to increase with increased redshift [CITE, Scoville et al 2016].

This report focuses on learning more about the gas that would create these stars. By observing molecular gas we can constrain star formation rate from a different and complementary approach, because we are not observing stars directly but instead we are observing regions where stars form.
