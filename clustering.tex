\chapter{Clustering}

Wide ASPECS' well-defined, large cosmic volume allows for some of the first direct constraints on the clustering bias of CO emitters. This clustering bias can be then used to constrain the typical halo mass in which they reside. 

\section{Previous Work}

Previous work on clustering has been looked at different subpopulations of galaxies. Hickox et al. 2011 looked at the clustering of quasars and concealed quasars. Hickox et al. 2012 looks at the clustering in SMGs and compares them to clustering found in other surveys.

[1. show the 4 panel plot (for only 1 binding choice), with the different S/N cuts (or better for fidelity cuts, if that is not so time consuming to do), to show how the clustering signal is going up. 
2. Then explain how you selected your final sample (then selecting all candidates with fidelity >0.6) and show the clustering plot for that particular case. For this case show your preferred binning (and remember to choose the starting point of the first bin to have the minimum distances you measured between your candidates). 
3. Provide the final A and r0 parameters, and mention that you tested the sensitivity of the results with the binning choice (then maybe you can show your different binning choices for this same sample, and the r0 for each one)
4. we need to make some comments about this result (compare with others r0 in the literature, we can talk more about this). Make clear the point that the measurement is noisy and other strategies need to be done in the future.]

[I donâ€™t think you need to provide details in your report about how the cross-correlation works but just mention that this technique would improve the statistics and just provide some reference of papers in which this technique is used for example Croom+04, Coil+07, Padmanabhan+09, Hickox+11, Hickox+12, etc.]

[Spatial correlation measure-
ments provide information about the characteristic bias and hence
mass of the haloes in which galaxies reside (e.g., Kaiser 1984;
Bardeen et al. 1986), and so provide a robust mass estimate that is
free of many of the systematics in measuring stellar or black hole
masses. The observed clustering of SMGs and QSOs can thus allow
us to test whether these populations are found in similar haloes and
so may evolve into each other over short timescales. \cite{hickox2011clustering} 2012]

\section{Method}

\subsection{Autocorrelation Function}

The clustering is computed through a two point correlation function. The first step s to calculate the angular correlation function $ \omega(\theta)$. Once $ \omega(\theta)$ is computed, the second step is to obtain the two-point correlation function parameters of $r_0$ and $\gamma$.

The two-point correlation function is the the probability above Poisson of finding a galaxy in a volume element $dV$ at a physical separation $r$ from another randomly chosen galaxy, such that $$ dP = n[1 + \Eta(r)]dV$$, [REWORD] where $n$ is the mean space density of the galaxies in the sample. The estimator comes from Landy \& Szalay (1993) where $$ \omega(\theta) = \frac{1}{RR}(DD-2DR + RR)$$, there $DD$, $DR$, and $RR$ are the number of data-data, data-random, and random-random galaxy pairs at a separation $\theta$, where each of the three collections is normalized to sum to 1. 

Once the angular correlation function is found, a power-law model is fitted following $$\omega(\theta) = A\theta^{-\beta} $$ where $\beta$ = 0.8, a value found for many other galaxy autocorrelations \cite{hickox2011clustering}.

\subsection{Obtaining $r_0$ and $\gamma$}

To convert the $A$ and $\beta$ to real-space $r_0$ and $\gamma$, the conversion can be found through the two equations

$$ \gamma = \beta + 1 $$ $$ A = H_{\gamma}\frac{\int_{0}^{\inf} (dN_1/dz)(dN_2/dz)E_z\chi^{1 - \gamma} dz}{[\int_{0}^{\inf} (dN_1/dz)dz][\int_{0}^{\inf} (dN_2/dz)dz]}r_0^{\gamma}$$

where $H_{\gamma} = \Gamma(0.5)\Gamma(0.5[\gamma -1])\Gamma(0.5\gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function, $\chi$ is the radial comoving distance, $dN_{1,2}/dz$ are the redshift distributions of the samples, where in the case of autocorrelation, are equal to each other, and $E_z = H_z/c = dz/d\chi$ \cite{hickox2011clustering}. The Hubble parameter $H_z$ can be found from
$$H_z^2 = H_0^2[\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\lambda}]$$ \cite{hickox2011clustering}.

For this analysis, all CO line candidates above the 0.6 fidelity threshold were used, resulting in 35 sources, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Clustering_points}. Two catalogs of random points were created and their angular correlation computed to show that it is consistent with zero, shown in Fig.\ref{fig:random_points}. As a comparison, the two point correlation function was also computed for other fidelity cuts. The redshift distribution was taken from the CO redshifts of the lines, and the calculations were calculated over the range z = 1.5 to 3.5, as this is the range where most of the CO candidates seem to lie. The angular correlation function was computed over the range of 8.39 to 582.10 arcseconds, using logarithmically spaced bins.

\section{Results}

As can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:Angular_correlation}, as the fidelity increases, $A$ increases as well. The change is most significant when only fitting the positive points.  When converted to $r_0$, the fidelity cuts result in $r_0$ values of 23 +- 5 for fidelity $>$ 0.7, 20 +- 2 for fidelity $>$ 0.6, 8 +- 1.5 for fidelity $>$ 0.5, and no $r_0$ for fidelity > 0.4, as the $A$ value is consistent with 0.

\caption{Angular correlation function for various fidelity cuts. The bins increase logarithmically from 8.39 arcsecs to  The red lines are from fitting $\omega(\theta) = A\theta^{-0.8} $ to all of the bins. The green dashed line is from fitting that same equation only to bins that had a positive value. As the fidelity goes up, the $A$ value mostly increases as well, indicating stronger clustering. The few line candidates means that the results are quite noisy, and are sensitive to the bins chosen.}
\label{fig:Angular_correlation}
\end{figure}

Besides the different fidelity cuts, different binnings also are included to study their effects on the final $r_0$ results. The results seem to be very dependent on the binning. While the values for the only positively fitted bins does not change dramatically as the binning changes, the number of bins does make a different whether there are enough positively valued bins for a positive $A$ value.

\end{figure}

As should be expected, as the fidelity cut goes up, meaning a larger portion of the CO lines remaining are true sources, the clustering value becomes larger as well. Once the fidelity drops below 0.5, such that the majority of the lines should be false positives, the clustering values drop to be consistent with 0. The clustering values for a variety of fidelity cuts are shown in Table \ref{table:Clustering}

\section{Discussion}

The clustering results do show that there is a larger $r_0$ as the fidelity cut becomes higher, suggesting that there are real sources in the sample. On the other hand, the clustering measurement is still very noisy and future work will be required to get a better final clustering measurement. 

In comparison to other clustering measurements, \cite{hickox2011clustering} found an $r_0$ for quasers to be between 5.5 and 

\cite{hickox2011clustering} showed that for SMG galaxies, around a redshift of 2, the autocorrelation length $r_0 \approx 6 h^{-1} Mpc$. For the 35 sources used here, a slightly higher, but similar $r_0$ has been found.
